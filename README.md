Hi, my name is Ramon and I am interested in becoming a software engineer using C++. Currently, I am learning the basics of C++ and will be uploading some projects as I learn. 
I have some very basic knowledge of Python, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5. As of today, I only have three web site templates I can show upon request but they are very basic. 
To contact me please send me an email at ramon.d.hernandez28@gmail.com. Thanks and have a great day!
